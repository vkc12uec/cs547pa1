Return to work data were prospectively obtained from 155 adult burn patients who were employed before their injuries  Average time from burn to return to work was 63 days  and average time from discharge to return to work was 42 days  Size and depth of burn  occurrence of hand burns  age of the patient  and type of job significantly influenced return to work and return to work time  These data were compared to previous reports from this burn center and other burn centers  and it was concluded that return to work time is becoming shorter  More information must be scientifically gathered in order to determine all factors which influence return to work time  Researchers should direct their attention to those factors that are amenable to intervention from the burn team

To determine the current incidence and outcome of iatrogenic retinal breaks occurring during pars plana vitrectomy  the authors reviewed 404 consecutive operations done on eyes without preexisting retinal breaks  Thirteen eyes had 14 iatrogenic peripheral retinal breaks  Three other eyes had both peripheral breaks and posterior breaks  Twenty five eyes had 43 posterior breaks  The incidence of peripheral breaks was 4% and of posterior breaks was 6%  Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy had a higher incidence of iatrogenic retinal breaks than those with other diagnoses  Peripheral breaks occurred most commonly just posterior to the site of insertion of the vitrectomy probe  Although six eyes required reoperation  33 of 38 eyes had a successful anatomic outcome

The finding that patients with neglect make larger errors when bisecting longer lines could be due to failure to disengage attention from a segment of the line on the ipsilesional side  or to a reduced ability to direct attention and/or action contralaterally  The findings are reported from a patient with left sided neglect who set the midpoint further away from the right end of lines as their length increased  a finding consistent with the latter interpretation  His errors were significantly related to length and lateral extent of lines presented in left hemispace  but only to length of lines presented in right hemispace

Patients with unilateral spatial neglect fail to report or respond to stimuli contralateral to the lesion which usually involves the right parietal lobe  When asked to mark the centre of a horizontal line  these patients place the mark to the right of the true midpoint  It has been considered that they neglect the left part of the line and bisect the perceived line segment  We investigated the eye fixation patterns of hemianopic patients with or without unilateral spatial neglect during the bisection of lines  using an eye camera  Hemianopic patients without unilateral spatial neglect saw the whole lines  searching to the endpoint on the hemianopic side  and bisected it correctly  In contrast  left hemianopics with unilateral spatial neglect never searched to the left hemianopic side  Once they fixated a certain point on the right part of the line  they persisted with this point and marked the subjective midpoint there  Taking left homonymous hemianopia into account  the subjective midpoint appeared to be marked  not at the centre of the line segment perceived in the seeing right visual field  but at the leftmost point of it  However  they could appreciate the deviation of the subjective midpoint in the right visual field when forced to fixate the left endpoint of the line  These findings suggest that the left hemisphere has the ability to estimate the midpoint of the line through the right visual field and that visuospatial disorder in the line bisection test is attributable to the pathological change in the right hemisphere  The results are interpreted to mean that left hemianopic patients with unilateral spatial neglect see a totalized image of a line extending equally to either side of the point where they are going to mark the subjective midpoint  We considered that the right hemisphere completes the line  using the visual input relating to the right part of the line perceived by the left hemisphere

We are convinced that a best interests approach is the best approach to take in making decisions to treat or not to treat disabled young infants  Such an approach acknowledges that there are some medical conditions that are so severe that efforts to sustain the lives of infants having the conditions cannot be said to be in the best interests of those infants  By paying attention to the variables that compose the best interests approach  decision makers can arrive at decisions not to sustain life that are more easily justifiable than with any other approach
