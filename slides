Part 1:	improving readability by usage of the correct hypernym (using Microsoft n-gram service)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While providing for anonymization, we 
	1. infer the sense of word (noun)
	2. replace the sensitive word with a more general word (i.e. its hypernym)

Now, out of various available hypernyms of a word, we have to choose the best which can give a better likelihood of 'forming a correct' sentence. 

For e.g. consider a sentence having sensitive information as follows:
	person x used marijuana for phantom limb pain

hypernyms(marijuana) => {controlled substance, soft drug}

person x used soft drug for phantom limb pain => -3.233194
person x used controlled substance for phantom limb pain => -1.111096

Clearly, using "soft drug" rather than "controlled substance" gives a better readability to the user.

Another e.g. could be:
	alcohol affected head

//  => -5.280477
hypernyms (head) => { brain, mind}

alcohol affected brain => -2.225491
alcohol affected mind => -5.053861

Clearly, using "brain" rather than "mind" gives a better readability to the user.

Part 2: Blind generalization of ambiguous abstracts
---------------------------------------------------

To see the utility variation from full generalization v/s our algorithm, we took a number of abstracts whose ambiguity values are quite high.

We processed each abstract by replacing its nouns(X) by the common parent of synsets of nouns (X)

For e.g.:

O:A surgical head rest is described that gives good wrist support, provides space to place instruments, and allows drainage of irrigation fluid.

N:A surgical entity entity is described that gives good wrist entity , provides entity to place instruments , and allows drain of activity fluid .

Notations:	O:	original abstract	N:	fully generalised version

TODO:

O:A case of nonvesicular dermatitis herpetiformis with clear-cut perimenstrual exacerbations is described and differentiated from autoimmune progesterone dermatitis.

N:A entity of nonvesicular dermatitis herpetiformis with clear-cut perimenstrual exacerbations is described and differentiated from autoimmune progesterone dermatitis .

vkc says:	dermatitis is a skin disease , but we are not generalizing it, becoz it has just one synset
